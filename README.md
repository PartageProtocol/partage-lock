The Partage lock is a Blockchain-controlled smart lock that allows owners and utility providers to lock their physical assets in a vault, a garage, or a house, and remotely manage users' access through crypto payments. It is built on the Near blockchain in an open-source fashion, using standard open hardware, so that anyone can follow our tutorial and contribute to the Near ecosystem growth by deploying their own blockchain utilities in real life. All elements about the Partage lock are available on our landing page https://lock.hellopartage.xyz. By connecting your wallet you will also be able to experience the full UX of our app.
