      <ol>
        <li>
          Look in <code>frontend/App.js</code> - you'll see <code>getGreeting</code> and <code>setGreeting</code> being called on <code>contract</code>. What's this?
        </li>
        <li>
          Ultimately, this <code>contract</code> code is defined in <code>./contract</code> â€“ this is the source code for your <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/overview">smart contract</a>.</li>
        <li>
          When you run <code>npm run deploy</code>, the code in <code>./contract</code> gets deployed to the NEAR testnet. You can see how this happens by looking in <code>package.json</code>.</li>
